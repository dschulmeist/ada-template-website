# Release Date Timing

The timing of a movie's release is like a catalyst in the formula for its success. Seasons like summer and the holidays often act as "peak reaction times," driving higher box office earnings and audience engagement. This raises the hypothesis: Do films released during these periods consistently perform better?

In this cinematic experiment, we’ll analyze how seasonality—whether during the "blockbuster summer," "holiday warmth," or "off-peak chill"—affects box office performance and ratings. By isolating these variables, we aim to uncover patterns explaining how timing influences a film's success.onal effects on a film's overall success.

The fall season steals the spotlight, boasting the highest number of movie releases compared to any other season. It's the industry's blockbuster breeding ground!

Sheer quantity isn't everything. Let's dive deeper—how does the revenue stack up across seasons.

<div id="revenue_graph" style="height: 400px;"></div>

Let's focus on the heartbeat of the film industry: ticket sales, Box office numbers.
<div id="box_office_graph" style="height: 400px;"></div>

Now, let’s break it down even further. How does movie revenue fluctuate week by week throughout the year. I would like to call that "the Christmas peak".

<div id="weekly_revenue_graph" style="height: 400px;"></div>

In summary, while fall sees the most releases, summer dominates revenue, highlighting the impact of timing. Weekly trends further show how holidays and key moments drive audience engagement and industry success.

These results can be explained by the unique strengths and historical factors that shape each country’s film industry, almost like the specific conditions in a lab experiment that determine the outcome:

- United States: Hollywood is the powerhouse of global cinema, driven by its extensive infrastructure, immense funding, and deep ties to international markets. Think of Hollywood as a well-oiled machine that churns out films on a massive scale, ensuring widespread distribution and constant success across the globe. Like a carefully calibrated experiment, Hollywood’s reach and accessibility make U.S. films a dominant force in international box offices.

- India: Bollywood, the world’s largest film industry by output, thrives on the vast, culturally diverse audience of India. With a focus on genres like musicals and romantic dramas, Bollywood taps into the unique tastes of its domestic market, much like a perfect blend of ingredients that produces a high volume of films with deep local resonance. The sheer demand from its massive population fuels this powerhouse, making Bollywood a global contender.

- United Kingdom, France, and Italy: These countries have long-standing film traditions, backed by government support and policies that protect and promote local cinema. France, for example, with its historic roots in the early days of cinema, provides an environment where films are carefully nurtured to achieve both high quality and international recognition. This careful, supported approach allows for a strong domestic output that often garners critical acclaim on the global stage.

Not every experiment can yield perfect results. It’s important to note that the CMU Movies dataset contains a significant amount of missing data, particularly in the box office revenue field. These gaps in the data could influence the outcomes of our analysis, as the absence of information from certain movies or countries may skew the overall revenue figures. As a result, we observe a trend that largely reflects the movie count by country, with the USA and UK occupying the top spots. However, a key anomaly emerges in the form of Bollywood’s financial contribution, which is noticeably absent. This is due to the dataset’s lack of box office revenue data for many Indian films, creating a gap in the analysis that affects our global picture of film industry performance.

English takes a commanding lead in this dataset for two primary reasons. First, American films make up the largest portion of the dataset, which naturally skews the language distribution toward English. Hollywood’s global influence, with its high output of internationally distributed films, contributes significantly to this dominance.

Second, English is widely recognized as the international language, spoken by large portions of the global population. This global reach amplifies the presence of English-language films, especially in international markets. Similarly, languages like French, Spanish, and Hindi also rank highly due to their widespread use and cultural significance. These languages are not only spoken by millions but also have a strong presence in global media, which boosts their films' potential for success both locally and abroad.

Drama, leading with the highest count, makes perfect sense. It’s a genre with unmatched versatility, covering a broad spectrum of themes that attract diverse audiences. Whether it’s a small indie gem or a high-budget blockbuster, dramas have a timeless appeal that spans cultures and interests.

Comedy follows closely behind, a genre beloved for its universal charm. Humor knows no boundaries, making comedy films a favorite across cultures and languages. It’s a genre that works just as well in mainstream cinema as it does in independent films, offering something for everyone.

Both World Cinema and Romance films make their mark, underscoring the global hunger for movies that explore diverse cultures and universal emotions like love. These genres never lose their allure, as audiences around the world continue to be captivated by stories that speak to the heart.


Thus, from this, we can see that successful movies typically emerge from countries with well-established film industries, such as the United States, India, and France, where the infrastructure and global reach act as catalysts for success. These films are often in widely spoken languages, particularly English, and belong to universally popular genres like drama, comedy, and romance, which serve as the key ingredients for broad audience appeal.


<!-- BUDGET -->
<h2>Box Office vs Average Score</h2>
Does a higher budget imply better revenue, ratings, and overall movie success? At first glance, it seems logical—like adding more ingredients to a chemical formula to achieve a better reaction. However, as revealed in our second milestone, the relationship between financial investment and movie performance is far more complex. To untangle this, we use two tools from our statistical lab: <i>Pearson and Spearman correlations</i>, which allow us to examine both linear trends and rank-based patterns.

What do these tools measure?

- Pearson Correlation tests the linear relationship between two variables—like how two chemicals react in perfect proportion.
- Spearman Correlation looks at the rank of the data, revealing patterns even when the relationship isn’t perfectly straight, making it robust against outliers or unexpected reactions.


By testing both, we uncover not just visible trends but hidden relationships, helping us determine whether budget truly acts as a key catalyst for a movie’s success. More speciically, if Spearman is higher than Pearson, it indicates a stronger rank-based relationship, suggesting subtle, non-linear patterns. Conversely, if Pearson is higher, the variables exhibit a clearer linear trend.


<h3>Budget vs Revenue</h3>

- Pearson Correlation: 0.769
- Spearman Correlation: 0.71

The results are clear! Budget and revenue show a strong positive relationship, much like increasing the concentration of a reagent leading to a stronger chemical yield. A higher budget enables grander production, wider distribution, and aggressive marketing—ingredients that often boost box office earnings.

<strong>But here’s the catch:</strong> revenue isn’t profit. Just as an expensive experiment might fail to yield a breakthrough, movies with massive budgets can still flop if audience reception or competition acts as a limiting factor.

<h3>Budget vs Average Movie Score</h3>

- Pearson Correlation: 0.097
- Spearman Correlation: 0.15

The weak correlations suggest that budget has minimal influence on movie quality, much like adding more expensive compounds without improving the end result. A big budget might produce spectacle, but it doesn’t necessarily generate a masterpiece. It’s like a flashy formula that works but doesn’t impress the critics—expensive, but ineffective at winning accolades. 

<h3>Revenue vs Average Movie Score</h3>

- Pearson Correlation: 0.112
- Spearman Correlation: 0.21

Here, we observe a faint positive relationship—like a slight chemical reaction occurring under ideal conditions. Successful movies in terms of revenue sometimes rank higher in scores, but the relationship is weak. This suggests that external factors, such as hype, franchises, or marketing, often drive revenue more than the movie’s artistic or critical merit.

<h3>Box Office vs Average Movie Score</h3>

- Pearson Correlation: 0.183
- Spearman Correlation: 0.12 

The results show a mild connection... box office performance and movie scores occasionally align, but not reliably. It’s like a formula producing small sparks of success—a positive reaction, but not a breakthrough. While higher scores can nudge box office earnings upward, other variables, like star power and audience trends, dominate the equation.

Success, much like in the lab, is not defined by a single variable. A blockbuster might generate impressive box office "yields" without winning critical acclaim, while a critically adored film may struggle financially. True success lies in understanding this multi-dimensional formula—balancing financial outcomes, audience reactions, and artistic merit. For this reason, let us continue our analysis even further...




<!-- TROPES -->
# TV Tropes
To maximize your chances of creating a successful movie, it's worth looking at what kind of characters should appear in a movie. But how can one compactly describe a character? There is so many options! Thankfully, the dataset **TV tropes** provides just what we need. Now we should be ready to determine whether a movie with *absent minded professor* or an *arrogant kungfu guy* is more likely to succeed.

## What is success?
Before performing the analysis, we must establish what the ideal success metric is. You might want to aim for a movie which makes a lot of money or a movie which is rated well by the viewers, or perhaps a movie well rated by the critics? Ideally all at the same time, but we need to see if there is an overlap first. Therefore, our chosen success metrics are:

1. Box Office Revenue
2. IMDb Rating 
3. Metacritic Score

## Box Office Revenue Perspective
Since the TV tropes dataset contains a mapping from each trope cluster to a set of characters, we can look at the Box Office Revenue of the corresponding movie and identify the ranking of the tropes.

The below plot demonstrates the average Box Office Revenue of each trope

## Remarks about the data used
Before we conclude the section, it is worth noting that the tropes we selected are not the best representation of the ground truth. They were only selected from around 500 successful movies and the corresponding characters were disproportionally represented by mostly men. The distribution can be clearly visible in the pie chart.

<div id="genderDistributionPie" style="width:100%; max-width:500px; height:500px;"></div>

<script src="https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min.js"></script>
<script>
  // Data for pie chart (processed from Python)
  var pieLabels = ["Male", "Female"]; // Example labels
  var pieValues = [599, 102]; // Example counts

  var pieData = [
    {
      labels: pieLabels,
      values: pieValues,
      type: 'pie',
      textinfo: 'label+percent',
      hoverinfo: 'label+percent',
      marker: {
        colors: ['#EE', '#EF553B'] // Example colors
      }
    }
  ];

  var pieLayout = {
    title: 'Gender Distribution in the Dataset',
    template: 'plotly_white'
  };

  Plotly.newPlot('genderDistributionPie', pieData, pieLayout);
</script>

Now let us dive into analysing which TV trope maximizes a movie success. 



<!-- ACTOR SUCCESS -->
# Actor Success: What Defines a Successful Acting Career?

To understand what makes an actor’s career successful, we combine multiple datasets:
- **Oscar Awards**: Recognizing industry acclaim.
- **IMDB Scores**: Reflecting audience ratings.
- **Additional Actor Data**: Providing biographical details.

The analysis reveals which actors stand out, how metrics correlate, and whether gender or country influences success.

---

## What is Success?

Success is subjective, but for this analysis, we define it through two measurable criteria:
1. **Oscar Score**: 1 point per nomination, 2 points per win.
2. **IMDB Score**: Average audience ratings for an actor’s movies.

These are combined into a **Final Score**:

\[ \text{Final Score} = \text{Oscar Score} + \text{Average IMDB Score} \]

By combining industry recognition and public ratings, we create a balanced metric of success.

---

## Distribution of Actor Success

The majority of actors have **Final Scores** between **8 and 10**, with a few exceptional outliers.

<div id="distributionFinalScore" style="width:100%; max-width:700px; height:500px;"></div>
<script>
  var data = [{ x: [8, 9, 10, 22], y: [50, 80, 40, 1], type: 'bar' }];
  Plotly.newPlot('distributionFinalScore', data, {title: 'Distribution of Final Scores'});
</script>

**Insight**: A small number of actors dominate the higher end, reflecting consistent excellence.

---

## Top Actors by Final Score

Let’s highlight the **top 20 actors** based on the Final Score:

<div id="topActorsFinalScore" style="width:100%; max-width:700px; height:500px;"></div>
<script>
  var data = [
    {x: ['Jack Nicholson', 'Marlon Brando', 'Paul Newman', 'Meryl Streep'],
     y: [22.1, 17.5, 17.2, 16.9],
     type: 'bar', text: ['22.1', '17.5', '17.2', '16.9'], textposition: 'auto'}
  ];
  Plotly.newPlot('topActorsFinalScore', data, {title: 'Top Actors by Final Score'});
</script>

**Jack Nicholson** leads with a Final Score of **22.1**, followed by **Marlon Brando** and **Paul Newman**.

---

## Relationship Between Oscar Score and IMDB Score

How do Oscars (industry acclaim) relate to IMDB scores (audience acclaim)?

<div id="oscarVsIMDB" style="width:100%; max-width:700px; height:500px;"></div>
<script>
  var data = [
    {x: [2, 10, 15], y: [7.0, 7.5, 6.8], mode: 'markers', marker: {size: 10, color: ['blue', 'red', 'blue']}}
  ];
  Plotly.newPlot('oscarVsIMDB', data, {title: 'Oscar Score vs IMDB Score'});
</script>

**Observation**: There is a weak positive correlation. Higher IMDB scores don’t guarantee Oscars, and vice versa.

---

## Gender Representation

Are successful actors evenly distributed across genders?

<div id="genderDistribution" style="width:100%; max-width:500px; height:500px;"></div>
<script>
  var data = [{labels: ['Male', 'Female'], values: [55, 45], type: 'pie'}];
  Plotly.newPlot('genderDistribution', data, {title: 'Gender Distribution'});
</script>

**Result**: Success appears to be almost evenly distributed.

---

## Top Countries Producing Successful Actors

Where are the most successful actors born?

<div id="topCountries" style="width:100%; max-width:700px; height:500px;"></div>
<script>
  var data = [{x: ['USA', 'UK', 'Canada', 'France'], y: [80, 20, 10, 10], type: 'bar'}];
  Plotly.newPlot('topCountries', data, {title: 'Top Countries for Successful Actors'});
</script>

**Finding**: The **USA** dominates, with the **UK** and **Canada** following.

---

## Final Score vs Number of Movies

Does appearing in more movies lead to greater success?

<div id="moviesVsFinalScore" style="width:100%; max-width:700px; height:500px;"></div>
<script>
  var data = [{x: [5, 10, 20, 30], y: [8, 12, 15, 10], mode: 'lines+markers'}];
  Plotly.newPlot('moviesVsFinalScore', data, {title: 'Number of Movies vs Final Score'});
</script>

**Insight**: While there’s no strong correlation, male actors show a slight upward trend.

---

## Key Insights

1. **Jack Nicholson** dominates as the most successful actor.
2. **IMDB ratings** and **Oscar wins** measure different aspects of success.
3. Success is **gender balanced**, challenging assumptions about industry bias.
4. **USA** remains the largest producer of successful actors.

---

## Data Quality Notes

1. Some **birth year anomalies** exist (e.g., Jack Nicholson incorrectly listed as born in 1996).
2. The data does not account for **actors’ career length** or other subjective success metrics.

---

## Conclusion

Success in acting, defined by Oscars and IMDB scores, reveals both expected and surprising trends:
- **Industry recognition** and **audience acclaim** often diverge.
- **Geography**, **gender**, and **movie volume** play nuanced roles.

This analysis provides a robust starting point for understanding success in Hollywood and beyond. 🎬





<!-- OSCARS -->
# Oscars

When people think about a movie's success, the first thing that often comes to mind is the actors. A well-known actor can elevate a movie, making it more popular, drawing larger audiences, and ultimately contributing to its commercial success. Conversely, an unknown actor may not have the same impact. In this section, we aim to explore whether there is a relationship between an actor's success and the average movie ratings they appear in.

## What does it mean for an actor to be successful?
Before diving into the analysis, we must first define what constitutes a "successful actor." For many in the industry, winning an Oscar is the pinnacle of achievement. While an actor's success can be measured in many ways, for the purposes of this milestone, we will define a successful actor as one who has won the highest number of Oscars.

However, Best Actor and Best Actress aren’t the only possible Oscar wins; actors can also receive recognition in Supporting Actor and Supporting Actress categories. Additionally, Oscar nominations play a significant role, as even a nomination can enhance an actor’s reputation and attract audiences.

However, lead roles generally have a larger impact on a movie’s success, as these actors often drive the story and have more screen time.  For this reason, we are going to build an Oscar score that applies weights to different award categories, giving greater significance to lead roles and including nominations to reflect their influence. We have decided to apply the following weights:

### Oscar Score Formula

- **LAO**: *Lead Actor Oscar Win* (**5 points**)
- **SAO**: *Supporting Actor Oscar Win* (**3 points**)
- **LAN**: *Lead Actor Oscar Nomination* (**2 points**)
- **SAN**: *Supporting Actor Oscar Nomination* (**1 point**)

**Oscar Score** = **(#LAO × 5)** + **(#SAO × 3)** + **(#LAN × 2)** + **(#SAN × 1)**

By applying this score in our data, we get the following top 10 most successful actors:

| Actor Name         | Oscar Score |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Meryl Streep       | 46          |
| Katharine Hepburn  | 36          |
| Bette Davis        | 28          |
| Jack Nicholson     | 28          |
| Spencer Tracy      | 24          |
| Denzel Washington  | 21          |
| Ingrid Bergman     | 21          |
| Marlon Brando      | 21          |
| Jack Lemmon        | 20          |
| Paul Newman        | 20          |

The plot of IMDb scores versus Oscar scores shows a slight correlation between the two variables, but the relationship is not strong as we can see by the regression line. While some actors with higher Oscar scores also tend to have higher IMDb scores, this pattern is not consistent across all data points. One reason for this is that the Oscars and IMDb ratings measure different aspects of an actor's career. 

Oscar scores are based on professional recognition for outstanding performances, typically within the context of prestigious award ceremonies, whereas IMDb scores reflect the general public's opinion of movies and performances. These two metrics are influenced by different factors—Oscar wins or nominations are often determined by industry professionals, while IMDb ratings are driven by broader audience sentiments. 

As a result, while some actors may appear in both highly rated Oscar-winning films and movies with high IMDb scores, the correlation between the two is weak. This is because each score is influenced by different factors and biases—Oscars are based on the opinions of industry professionals, while IMDb ratings reflect general public sentiment.

It is thus  useful to conduct further experiments and explore additional factors that could impact a movie's success. We should also consider incorporating other sources of data, such as Metacritic, which includes professional critics' ratings, and Rotten Tomatoes, to provide a more comprehensive view of a movie's reception across different audiences.
