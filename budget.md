<h2>Box Office vs Average Score</h2>
Does a higher budget imply better revenue, ratings, and overall movie success? At first glance, it seems logical—like adding more ingredients to a chemical formula to achieve a better reaction. However, as revealed in our second milestone, the relationship between financial investment and movie performance is far more complex. To untangle this, we use two tools from our statistical lab: <i>Pearson and Spearman correlations</i>, which allow us to examine both linear trends and rank-based patterns.

What do these tools measure?

- Pearson Correlation tests the linear relationship between two variables—like how two chemicals react in perfect proportion.
- Spearman Correlation looks at the rank of the data, revealing patterns even when the relationship isn’t perfectly straight, making it robust against outliers or unexpected reactions.


By testing both, we uncover not just visible trends but hidden relationships, helping us determine whether budget truly acts as a key catalyst for a movie’s success. More speciically, if Spearman is higher than Pearson, it indicates a stronger rank-based relationship, suggesting subtle, non-linear patterns. Conversely, if Pearson is higher, the variables exhibit a clearer linear trend.


<h3>Budget vs Revenue</h3>

- Pearson Correlation: 0.769
- Spearman Correlation: 0.71

The results are clear! Budget and revenue show a strong positive relationship, much like increasing the concentration of a reagent leading to a stronger chemical yield. A higher budget enables grander production, wider distribution, and aggressive marketing—ingredients that often boost box office earnings.

<strong>But here’s the catch:</strong> revenue isn’t profit. Just as an expensive experiment might fail to yield a breakthrough, movies with massive budgets can still flop if audience reception or competition acts as a limiting factor.

<h3>Budget vs Average Movie Score</h3>

- Pearson Correlation: 0.097
- Spearman Correlation: 0.15

The weak correlations suggest that budget has minimal influence on movie quality, much like adding more expensive compounds without improving the end result. A big budget might produce spectacle, but it doesn’t necessarily generate a masterpiece. It’s like a flashy formula that works but doesn’t impress the critics—expensive, but ineffective at winning accolades. 

<h3>Revenue vs Average Movie Score</h3>

- Pearson Correlation: 0.112
- Spearman Correlation: 0.21

Here, we observe a faint positive relationship—like a slight chemical reaction occurring under ideal conditions. Successful movies in terms of revenue sometimes rank higher in scores, but the relationship is weak. This suggests that external factors, such as hype, franchises, or marketing, often drive revenue more than the movie’s artistic or critical merit.

<h3>Box Office vs Average Movie Score</h3>

- Pearson Correlation: 0.183
- Spearman Correlation: 0.12 

The results show a mild connection... box office performance and movie scores occasionally align, but not reliably. It’s like a formula producing small sparks of success—a positive reaction, but not a breakthrough. While higher scores can nudge box office earnings upward, other variables, like star power and audience trends, dominate the equation.

Success, much like in the lab, is not defined by a single variable. A blockbuster might generate impressive box office "yields" without winning critical acclaim, while a critically adored film may struggle financially. True success lies in understanding this multi-dimensional formula—balancing financial outcomes, audience reactions, and artistic merit. For this reason, let us continue our analysis even further...
